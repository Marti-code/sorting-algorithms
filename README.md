# Sorting Algorithms Project

This project implements and benchmarks various sorting algorithms in C++.

## Description

This project is designed to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms. Users can choose which sorting algorithm to use and can sort a random, sorted in asc or desc order array of integers. The sorting algorithms have been optimized for performance where possible.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort with Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Quicksort with Hoare partition scheme
- Heapsort 
- Shell Sort using Knuth's sequence

## Setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithms.git
   cd sorting-algorithms
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o sorting_algorithms
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
